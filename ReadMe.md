# BreakableWallRandomiser

Randomizes some walls in the game hollow knight. Currently randomizes, with a few exceptions:
 - Any wall with FSM breakable_wall_v2
 - Any wall with FSM break_floor

### Usage
Install the mod as usual. Ensure you have Randomizer 4 (RandomizerCore) and Satchel (SFCore) installed too.

Do note: It isn't out of the question that you might encounter some logic errors when playing with this mod. I've managed a full playthrough, but your mileage may vary.
